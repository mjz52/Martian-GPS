 This file contains coefficients and related data for the JPL Mars gravity
 field MRO120D, a 120th degree and order spherical harmonic model. It is the 
 fifth archived JPL gravity field that includes Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter 
 (MRO) tracking data.

 The summary of radio tracking data this gravity field is as follows:
   MGS Gravity Calibration Orbit (GCO) including
       fixed high-gain antenna mapping         1999-02-02 to 1999-03-29
       Mapping Orbit (MAP)                     1999-03-29 to 2006-09-23
       Note: This solution contains all useful MGS data prior to loss of
             contact with the spacecraft in Nov., 2006.
   Odyssey Transition Orbit (ODYT)             2002-01-11 to 2002-01-15
           Mapping Orbit (ODYM)                2002-02-11 to 2015-01-03
   MRO Transition Orbit (MROT)                 2006-08-30 to 2006-09-11
       Mapping Orbit (MROM)                    2006-09-11 to 2015-04-30
   Pathfinder                                  1997-07-04 to 1997-10-07
   Viking 1 Lander                             1976-07-21 to 1982-11-13
   MER Opportunity Lander                      2012-01-02 to 2012-05-02

 Some details describing this model are:
   The spherical harmonic coefficients are fully normalized.
   The reference radius = 3396.0 km
   The prime meridian of this model is defined by the longitude of the
       Viking 1 Lander qqual to -47.95137 deg.
   The Mars System GM (Mars+Phobs+Deimos) = 42828.3758078 km^3/sec^2
       The GM of Mars = 42828.3750104/sec^2
       The GM of Phobos = 7.11x10^-4 km^3/sec^2
       The GM of Deimos = 9.46x10^-5 km^3/sec^2
   The Viking and Mariner 9 orbiter data are not included in this delivery
       unlike some past deliveries which included this data. This data do
       not seem to add any more information for the gravity although there 
       is some Phobos and Deimos GM information in the data. The values for
       the Phobos and Deimos GM given here do not include the Viking and 
       Mariner 9 orbiter data.
   The Mars-fixed reference frame is given by Konopliv et al. (2006) except
       with updated orientation parameters that are either estimated in the
       MRO120D solution or fixed to chosen values. The prime meridian of the
       MRO120D coordinate was chosen so that it agrees with the prime
       mreidian of the IAU 2000 coordinate frame to about 1.6 meters.
       The rotation from the body-fixed position rBF to the inertial
       postion rIN is:
          rIN = Rz(-N) Rx(-J) Rz(-PSI) Rx(-I) Rz(-PHI) rBF
       where N is the angle in the plane of the Earth-mean-equator of J2000
       (EME2000) from the vernal equinox (intersection of the mean ecliptic
       and EME2000 planes) to the intersection of the Mars-mean-orbit of 
       J2000 and EME2000 planes; J is the inclination of the Mars-mean-orbit
       plane relative to the EME2000 plane; PSI is the angle in the 
       Mars-mean-orbit plane from the intersection of the EME2000 and 
       Mars-mean-orbit planes to the intersection of the Mars-mean-orbit and 
       Mars-true-equator of date planes; I is the inclination of the 
       Mars-true-equator relative to the Mars-mean-orbit plane; PHI is the 
       angle in the plane of the Mars-true-equator from the intersection of 
       the Mars-mean-orbit plane and Mars-true-equator to the Mars prime 
       meridian.
       PSI, I, and PHI have J2000 epoch and secular values plus corrections
       for nuations. PHI in addition has seasonal corrections for spin.
       For example, PSI = PSI(t=J2000) + (dPSI/dt)*T + dPSI(nutations) where
       T is time past J2000 in days.
       For MRO120D, the values of the orientation angles are:
          N =  3.37919183 deg (fixed)
          J = 24.67682669 deg (fixed)
          PSI(t=J2000) = 81.9683988032 deg (estimated)
          dPSI/dt      = -0.0000057863 deg/day (estimated)
          I(t=J2000)   = 25.1893822930 deg (estimated)
          dI/dt        =  -0.000000001 deg/day (estimated)
          PHI(t=J2000) = 133.386276647 deg (fixed)
          dPHI/dt      = 350.891985307 deg/day (estimated)
        The estimated seasonal spin amplitudes for PHI with periods equal to 
        a Mars year, 1/2 year, 1/3 year, and 1/4 year and an epoch of 
        Jan. 1999 are given by
          PHI(  1yr,cosine) =  481 milliarcseconds
          PHI(  1yr,  sine) = -155 milliarcseconds
          PHI(1/2yr,cosine) = -103 milliarcseconds
          PHI(1/2yr,  sine) =  -93 milliarcseconds
          PHI(1/3yr,cosine) =  -35 milliarcseconds
          PHI(1/3yr,  sine) =   -3 milliarcseconds
          PHI(1/4yr,cosine) =  -10 milliarcseconds
          PHI(1/4yr,  sine) =   -8 milliarcseconds
   The number of radio tracking data (Doppler and range) observations for the
       various data blocks are as follows:
          MGS GCO at 370 km periapsis             =    140,735
          MGS MAP at 370 km periapsis             =  8,344,113
          Odyssey transistion at 200 km periapsis =     27,661
          Odyssey mapping at 390 km periapsis     = 12,574,331
          Pathfinder on the Mars surface          =      6,817
          Viking Lander on the Mars surface       =     14,156
          MRO transition at 200 km periapsis      =     72,127
          MRO mapping at 250 km periapsis         =  9,931,781
   A kaula type power law constraint is applied to the spherical harmonics
       coefficients beginning at degree 80. The MRO120D constraint uses a 
       similar taper as the constraint applied to MGS95J (see Fig. 5 of 
       Konopliv et al., 2006), but begins at degree 80.
   The k2 Love number to use with this MRO120D solution is 0.169. The
       second degree harmonic coefficients do not include the permanent
       tide due to the Love number.
   This delivery is the Mars static gravity field. However, the gravity
       field varies due to the mass exchange between the polar caps and
       the Mars atmosphere. The major component of this effect can be
       included in the gravity field by adding the following correction
       to the normalized J3 gravity coefficient:
          dJ3 = 2.95870587408D-09 * sin W*(t-t0)
       where W is the Mars mean motion = 191.39 deg/yr and t-t0 = years
       past Jan 1, 1999.
